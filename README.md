# Dependent Dropdown List in React Native

In this project I have created cascading dropdowns to display country, state and city list. Based on users selection of country list of state will apear and similarly based on country and state user will have list cities. 

This project is done with the help of API from https://countrystatecity.in/ and the select dropdown has been created with [react native element dropdown](https://github.com/hoaphantn7604/react-native-element-dropdown) package.
